# Simulation runner

### The problem
When a simulation is used to study a problem it is generally not sufficient to only look at a single case.
There are usually multiple variables that can be changed to study their effects on the end result.
This usually results in a few hours of changing the code or variables slightly to see the effect on the simulation, 
even longer if the code takes a while to run.
So it would be great to be able to give a program all the initial conditions and let it run in the background.
The output of the different runs will be saved in csv files or other specified in the simulation itself this is 
what this project seeks to accomplish.
